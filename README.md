# lambda_python_code
A repo with python code snippets for Tutorial Point Training in AWS lambda

I was going throught Tutorials Point AWS Lmabda course and faced a challenge when they make exmaples using NodeJs while I only understand Pythpn.
I had to research how to write similar code to work and follow through with the tutorials.
I decided to share this for anybody who takes the tutorials and wants to use python.
